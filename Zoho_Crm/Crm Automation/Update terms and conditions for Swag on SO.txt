The Down Payment can be paid by credit card or check, but please note that we are unable to start Fabrication until the payment is received.  Full/balance payments are due prior to Installation (or shipping if it is manufactured only), unless stated otherwise. The balance will be charged to the payment method on file once the installation is scheduled to be complete. We are able to accept a check as well, but please note that we are unable to schedule installation until the payment is received. Additional changes and/or permit fees may apply and will be  invoiced separately post installation.  You will provide us with valid and updated credit card information, or with a valid purchase order or alternative document reasonably acceptable to us. If you provide credit card information to us, you authorize us to charge such a credit card for all purchased services listed in the quote/order. If your quote/order specifies that payment will be by a method other than a credit card, we will invoice you at the end of the project.

Lead times may be affected due to the following: Receipt of unsuitable artwork, delays in information and relevant files being received, delays in signing off final proofs, delays in receiving deposit payments, consistent changing of designs. Blink Signs therefore cannot be held liable for delays in production deadlines due to any of the above occurring." + "\n" + "Return Policy:" + "\n" + "Blink Signs does not accept returns.
